# PRESENTATION

I'm **Lorenzo Cesari**, of the University of Bologna. I'm 25 years old and nearing the completion of my master's program in **data science** in July 2022.


# REFERENCES

This project is inspired from the paper [Impact of COVID-19 emergency on residential water end-use consumption measured with a high-resolution IoT system](https://iwaponline.com/aqua/article/70/8/1248/85076/Impact-of-COVID-19-emergency-on-residential-water) by `A. Di Mauro`; `G. F. Santonastaso`; `S. Venticinque`; `A. Di Nardo`.

They develop exploratory contents of the data for understanding how the pandemic has affected the behavior of water users and their water consumption.

You can find a copy of the paper also in the **reference folder**.

# QUICK SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS 

Through the exploratory analysis, I explore in more detail the differences in water consumption between **workers** and **smart workers**.

My project contains a lot of interactive `plots` from which you can isolate and visualize your data portions of interest.

I also asked myself a **Machine Learning problem** and tried to solve it as well as I could.

It included **pre-processing pipelines**, **supervised learning models**, **training** and **testing**, and **Ensamble learning techniques**.

In conclusion, I describe a **real case scenario** in which my machine learning model may be useful, and how it can be implemented.


# PLESE NOTE 

The `README.md` files that are present in each folder explain briefly what each folder contains.

The core of the project is the [scripts folder](https://gitlab.com/Lcesari/90477-project/-/tree/main/scripts).
