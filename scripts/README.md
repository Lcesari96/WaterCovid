The **development of the analysis** is presented here in three Python `notebooks`.


`Setup` and `Import` are two **support `notebooks`** for the `Main` one, recalled from the `Main` in order to keep it as clean as possible.


- `Setup` contains all the required **python configurations**: library imports, Pre and user defined function and folder path definitions.


- `Import` contains the **import of the raw data** with manipulations, in order to make those interpretable and readable.


- `Main` contains the **core of the project** in which are described and applyed all the complex manipulations, techniques and interpretations.
